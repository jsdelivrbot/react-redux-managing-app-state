# FirstReactReduxProject

This is my First React Project using Redux. I have reached it, through the udemy course Modern React With Redux. Try it yourself. 

This project Covers:
>> Containers
>> Reducers / combineReducers
>> ActionCreators 
>> Actions

I've committed the code lecture by lecture, so if you have any issue you can check all the commits, its descriptions and the code differences.
